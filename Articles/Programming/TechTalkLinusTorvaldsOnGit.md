This high quality tech talk is from 2009, but has by no means become obsolete! This talk is very reflects on the differences between Git and other (older) version system. Focus is not on technology, but processes and people. For example, on the topic of being distributed, problems like commit rights, and repository corruption is brought up and show that problems are mitigated in a distributed model.

Now you'd think one versioning system is similar to another: It handles versions of files. In my experience after using Git for 10 years, it is *true pain* going back to inferior versioning system (in my case VSTFS).


Reasons for watching the talk

* It is a treasure trove of inspiration if you need to discuss versioning systems with colleagues - perhaps even persuading them to switch to Git.
* If you are not using Git, and you want an understanding of the problems Git solves better than your current versioning system.


A more detailed view

* The effects of distributed versioning system 
  * Commit rights
  * Repository corruption
  * Handling of many many repositories, merging and network of trust
  * The speed of Git over centralized versioning systems
* The effect of light weight branches and, more importantly, merging
* When something starts becoming fast and easy, you use it differently
* Security, content cannot be changed through back doors
